# MP3_Project
This is a final project for a Microcontrollers class taken at University of the Pacific. 
This is for use on a TI Microcontroller and involved wiring and connecting an SD card via SPI as well as a LCD display, and a self-written driver for a keypad. 
The end result worked excellent, some features included: 
-Elapsed Time
-Progress Bar
-Skip ahead
-Shuffle
-Playing Order Permanence
